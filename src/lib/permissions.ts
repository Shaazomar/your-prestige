 * spec asks for, without an extra Permission/RolePermission subsystem.
 *
 * NOTE — these roles replaced the CMS's original content-team roles (OWNER,
 * MARKETING, CONTENT, SEO, SUPPORT) when the inventory app took ownership of
 * the shared `Role` enum. The grants below are deliberately **least
 * privilege**: where the old capability had no obvious depot equivalent it was
 * dropped rather than guessed at, so a mis-mapping locks someone out instead
 * of handing them access they shouldn't have. Widen these once the intended
 * per-role capabilities are confirmed.
